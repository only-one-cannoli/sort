# Sorting algorithms

This repo contains implementations of insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort, three sorting algorithms mentioned in Erin Allard's excellent course [_Nail Your Python Interview_](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/nail-your-python-interview/) on LinkedIn Learning.  The time complexity of these implementations are verified using `pytest` and [the `big-O` package](https://pypi.org/project/big-O/).

# Getting started

After cloning down the repo, use `pipenv install` and `pipenv install -d` to install the necessary packages.  `pipenv run pytest test.py` then runs the tests.
